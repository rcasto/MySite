# MySite
Personal website and great start for yours too

## How to get started
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  If you don't you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- Make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed.  If you don't you can download it [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Open up terminal or the command prompt. Close it and reopen it if you already had it open.
- Run the command `git clone https://github.com/rcasto/MySite <where-to-save>`.  Of course replace `<where-to-save>` with the file path of where you want to save the MySite project. **Note: if you omit the `<where-to-save>` argument it will just create a "MySite" folder in the current working directory.**
- Run the command `cd <where-to-save>`, where `<where-to-save>` is the same file path you used in the previous step.
- To install the dependencies run the command `npm install`.  This will get both client and server side dependencies. **Note: if you are on Linux or OS X you may have to run the command `sudo npm install`**
- To start the server run the command `npm start`
- Navigate to the url [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000)
- Now you are up and running!
